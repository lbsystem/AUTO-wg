# AUTO-wg for Mikrotik
这是一个带webUI界面的自动化处理wireguard端口出现故障的程序<br />
##### This is a program with a web UI for automatically handling wireguard port failures
There are two operating modes. One is the full automatic mode, which requires the routerOS username and password and the public address. The second is the semi-automatic mode, which is suitable for users without a public address.<br />
This program is developed using node.js, html, css3, Mikrotik shell,and bash.<br />
If you need to run the node.js code directly, you need to deploy a node.js environment. If you don't have a node.js runtime environment or you don't want to deploy it, here we also provide a compiled executable file that you can use directly.
